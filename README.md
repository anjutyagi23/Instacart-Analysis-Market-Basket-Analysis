Analyzing and finding the co-relation of attributes in dataset and suggesting the users some items that he/she may buy again or along with a current order . In other words, the objective is to develop Market Basket Analysis model which helps in identifying the next product that might interest a customer.

Problem statement and Motivation:

In the current situation like global pandemic, offline shopping will be challenging and risky, due to which e-commerce sites like Instacart provides door delivery services that ease shopping experience for customers.

While we are working on recommendation, this has many benefits - this will help vendors increase their sales by recommending likely products to customers. At the same time, sales teams can develop more effective pricing, product placement, cross-sell and up-sell strategies.

**Data source:**

The data is collected from https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017. The dataset is anonymized and contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. The dataset is a relational set of files describing customers' orders over time.
